Assignments for SNHU CS300
Welcome to my CS300 repository! Here I will be uploading all of my projects including the .cpp files and pseudocode.

Reflecting on my course experience, I am proud of the work I have accomplished and how I developed my coding abilities. The projects for this course helped guide my progress as the assignments trained our ability to understand all aspects of a program. Each project followed a similar structure of loading in data and creating functions to execute commands in the user menu. Additionally, these assignments stressed the importance of error handling and providing detailed output to the user based on either program errors or the progress with each function. 

Approaching each project required an understanding of the underlining data and the best techniques for data storage. This meant evaluating different data structures like vectors, binary search trees, or hash tables, based on runtime analysis (Big-O analysis). Data structures have their own strengths and weaknesses that must be considered depending on the required functionality. After a data structure was determined, the next step was implmentation which came with countless roadblocks. From addressing collisions in hash tables to searching through the nodes of a binary search tree, I studied an infinite number of examples and watched numerous videos to understand the logic. Fortunately, the documentation on each of these data structures is extensive so I had a library of coding examples to model my code after. 

Overall, this experience exposed me to a side of coding that I did not value or take the time to consider. I never thought about the underlining data structures and how these decisions could impact the longterm functionality or runtime of a program. Moving forward, I will have a more detailed, organized, and meticulous style of writing code. This is a total transformation compared to my previous style where I would immediately rush into writing lines of code, only stopping to make a decision when I reached an error. 

Thank you Dr. Webb for your enthusiasm throughout the course and detailed feedback to support each of your students!!
